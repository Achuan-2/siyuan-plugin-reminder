## ü§î Guiding Philosophy Behind the Plugin: Bullet Journal Method

### What is the Bullet Journal Method

For those who want to learn about the Bullet Journal method, you can read ["The Bullet Journal Method: Track Your Past, Order Your Present, Plan Your Future"](https://bulletjournal.com/) and ["Bullet Journaling: A Comprehensive Guide"](https://book.douban.com/subject/36289807/).

Brief introduction to the Bullet Journal method:

> "Most people don't need to organize materials, they need to organize tasks."

Many knowledge management books and blogs advocate building a "second brain," but this concept should not be simply understood as creating a database. If we only aim to organize materials when building our second brain, we easily fall into the trap of categorizing for the sake of categorizing. In this case, we might spend a lot of time on detailed classification and structuring of materials, but this work has no connection to our actual goals or task advancement.

A true "second brain" is not merely a data storage system, but a practical tool that can guide action.

The Bullet Journal method, simply put, transforms note-taking from recording materials to avoid forgetting into **task-centered recording of "core task notes"**. This method emphasizes using notes as tools for action, rather than pure knowledge storage. It encourages us to **focus on actual tasks and actions, rather than over-focusing on organizing and categorizing materials**.

Notes should not be for copying and storing, but for creating, to help us turn everything into "what we want it to be."

### Why Not Use To-Do Apps Like TickTick for Task Management

The Bullet Journal method recommends not using to-do list software, but directly using note-taking software for task management, creating a task note system that can support yourself.

Because these tools lack a support system behind them, the daily action lists they create are often made without careful thought and planning. A bunch of miscellaneous tasks are simply moved from a chaotic mind to a list, remaining in a chaotic state. So when we face to-do lists, we still feel stressed, confused, and anxious.

Another most important reason is that tasks are crossed off after completion! And there's no good archiving and organizing process for these completed tasks. You might say, isn't this very satisfying? If a task ends after it's done, it means the task is unimportant or cannot extend more value. These software's note-taking and task management features are often designed for quick recording and task completion, but they don't provide a systematic way to continuously track and improve these tasks, nor do they treat these tasks and projects as personal treasures to be permanently preserved.

Although TickTick has note functionality, its note management and editing experience cannot compare with SiYuan Notes, and notes cannot be exported. This determines that I only use TickTick's note function for multi-platform synchronized recording of inbox notes.

The advantage of using note-taking software to build a task management system is that you can continuously improve project notes and task notes. Over time and with practice, project notes and task notes will record our full labor results and wisdom crystallization. Even if projects are archived, they can be easily retrieved when needed in the future. Only this way can these notes become our experience treasury, allowing value to continuously extend, helping us grow continuously, improve constantly, and do better and better.

### Core Principles of Creating Notes with the Bullet Journal Method

1. **One task, one note, task-centered**: The core of notes is tasks, not materials. Each note should revolve around a specific task. Each note should contain clear action purposes and action steps.
2. **Continuous iteration**: Notes should be continuously improved over time and practice, becoming an accumulation of personal knowledge and experience.
3. **Holistic perspective**: Notes should grasp tasks and projects from an overall perspective, avoiding fragmentation and isolation.
4. **Build project homepages, make good use of links**: Link all materials, related notes, task plans, and actual task progress needed for the project to the project homepage, forming a complete project homepage.

### Important Concepts for Running Time Management and Task Management with the Bullet Journal Method

1. **What really needs to be organized in time management and task management?**
   1. Choose what is important.
   2. Choose how I should act now.

2. **Is the core goal of time management and task management to get everything done?**
   1. The core goal of time management is not to get everything done, because essentially we cannot get everything done. The things we want to do and need to do are always more than the time we can allocate.
   2. So we must make choices. Choices are not arbitrary, but depend on systems. Through action correlation, task breakdown, and project integration, we can clarify what the best action is.

3. **What is the correct process for building a task management system?**
   - We should not bury ourselves in a pile of messy things and work hard. This might solve some problems, but will spend a lot of time and energy, and might even go in the wrong direction, ending up with nothing accomplished, feeling like we're busy for nothing.
   - The following order is very important:
     - First step: Set the goals you want to achieve.
     - Second step: Based on goals, set the functions we need, or what phased tasks need to be completed.
     - Third step: Start arranging our actions to gradually realize these functions and goals.

4. **How to build a time management and task management system that doesn't miss anything?**
   1. Time reminders
   2. But relying only on time reminders can still lead to forgetting due to not seeing them or changes in matters. Another technique is to place actions and tasks where I will definitely pass when I need them, usually somewhere in the project. When I need them, I will definitely pass by, definitely see them, and then take action. You can put related tasks in project notes according to action sequence, so when executing this project, you can know what to do next. This is another meaning of building project notes.

## üìù Usage Instructions

### Setting Task Reminders

1. Click "‚è∞" in the document or block menu to set time reminders.

   1. Set time reminders through document block menu
      ![PixPin_2025-06-14_12-38-46](https://assets.b3logfile.com/siyuan/1610205759005/assets/PixPin_2025-06-14_12-38-46-20250614123848-k70gwoh.png)

   2. For document blocks, a convenient "‚è∞" reminder button is also added to the document breadcrumb.
      ![PixPin_2025-06-14_12-46-44](https://assets.b3logfile.com/siyuan/1610205759005/assets/PixPin_2025-06-14_12-46-44-20250614124645-b55bmty.png)

   3. Supports multi-selection of blocks for batch time reminder settings
      ![PixPin_2025-06-14_12-47-45](https://assets.b3logfile.com/siyuan/1610205759005/assets/PixPin_2025-06-14_12-47-45-20250614124759-afjmj4v.png)

2. **Set Reminder**: Select reminder date, time, priority, category, and other information. (If a block or its document block already has a reminder set, the system will automatically inherit the previously set priority and category)
   ![PixPin_2025-06-14_12-36-42](https://assets.b3logfile.com/siyuan/1610205759005/assets/PixPin_2025-06-14_12-36-42-20250614123644-zr0a8pz.png)

3. Intelligent Recognition of Dates and Times in Titles

   1. When adding reminders, the plugin will intelligently recognize dates and times automatically based on event titles
      ![PixPin_2025-06-14_12-39-30](https://assets.b3logfile.com/siyuan/1610205759005/assets/PixPin_2025-06-14_12-39-30-20250614123936-2hxw68b.png)

   2. Click the ‚ú® button to the right of the title to automatically set time through natural language input
      ![PixPin_2025-06-14_12-40-30](https://assets.b3logfile.com/siyuan/1610205759005/assets/PixPin_2025-06-14_12-40-30-20250614124033-1xh2k1f.png)

   3. Multi-selection of blocks also supports intelligent recognition of dates and times
      ![PixPin_2025-06-14_12-49-05](https://assets.b3logfile.com/siyuan/1610205759005/assets/PixPin_2025-06-14_12-49-05-20250614124909-hj02c5y.png)

4. After creating a reminder, the plugin adds a "‚è∞" bookmark to the block. After deleting a reminder, it checks if the block still has unfinished reminders - if not, it removes the bookmark. When tasks are completed, it changes to use a "‚úÖ" bookmark.

### Reminder Notification Logic

1. After 6 PM each day, the plugin will remind once about all events for today.
   ![PixPin_2025-06-12_21-22-15](https://assets.b3logfile.com/siyuan/1610205759005/assets/PixPin_2025-06-12_21-22-15-20250612212226-ji5482r.png)

2. If a reminder time is set, the plugin will pop up a notification for the corresponding event when the reminder time is reached.
   ![PixPin_2025-06-14_12-53-20](https://assets.b3logfile.com/siyuan/1610205759005/assets/PixPin_2025-06-14_12-53-20-20250614125324-h9cbba6.png)

3. When notifications arrive, notification sounds will play. You can customize notification sounds in the plugin settings.

### Pomodoro Timer Usage Instructions

Supports right-clicking in the sidebar task note management panel to start Pomodoro timing.

The purpose of using the Pomodoro Technique has two aspects:

1. **Focused Work**: After starting the Pomodoro timer, you can only focus on the current task without thinking too much about things unrelated to the current task, and without thinking too much about long-term information that adds pressure. **"The past and future are not important, the only important moment is now"**. Making good use of the current Pomodoro, doing the current task well, and using the current time to do something are the priorities.

2. **Timely Rest**: Proper breaks are for going further with better condition. However, when resting, be careful not to easily open your phone or computer's social media sites to check messages. You should know that consuming entertainment information is actually not stress-relieving but stress-adding, and it doesn't let your body and eyes rest! Moreover, transitioning from entertainment to work requires buffer time, which will make starting the next Pomodoro particularly difficult, wasting the start time of the next Pomodoro. **Truly important and urgent matters will come to find you**. Most news doesn't even have the value of reading headlines - you should wait for important messages to find you, not actively wait for messages. So during Pomodoro break time, the correct way to rest is to walk around, drink water, and look out the window.

The plugin has been thoughtfully designed for the Pomodoro timer:

- Default window style
  ![](https://assets.b3logfile.com/siyuan/1610205759005/assets/network-asset-PixPin_2025-06-12_17-48-43-2025-06-12-20250612232102-ksxhyhu.png)

- Mini window style
  ![](https://assets.b3logfile.com/siyuan/1610205759005/assets/network-asset-PixPin_2025-06-12_17-36-35-2025-06-12-20250612232104-dmwpmng.png)

How to use the Pomodoro timer:

1. Configure work duration, break duration, and background sound in plugin settings.
   - **Pomodoro Work Duration**: Default 25 minutes.
   - **Pomodoro Short Break Duration**: Default 5 minutes.
   - **Pomodoro Long Break Duration**: Default 30 minutes.
   - **Sound Settings**: Enter local file paths or network URLs to set work, break, and end notification sounds.
