### What is the Bullet Journal Method

For those who want to learn about the Bullet Journal method, you can read ["The Bullet Journal Method"](https://bulletjournal.com/) and related materials.

Brief introduction to the Bullet Journal method:

"Most people don't need to organize materials, they need to organize tasks."

Many knowledge management books and blogs advocate building a "second brain," but this concept should not be simply understood as creating a database. If we only aim to organize materials when building our second brain, we easily fall into the trap of categorizing for the sake of categorizing. In this case, we might spend a lot of time on detailed classification and structuring of materials, but this work has no connection to our actual goals or task advancement.

A true "second brain" is not merely a data storage system, but a practical tool that can guide action.

The Bullet Journal method, simply put, transforms note-taking from recording materials to avoid forgetting into task-centered recording of "core task notes." This method emphasizes using notes as tools for action, rather than pure knowledge storage. It encourages us to focus on actual tasks and actions, rather than over-focusing on organizing and categorizing materials.

Notes should not be for copying and storing, but for creating, to help us turn everything into "what we want it to be."

### Why Not Use To-Do Apps Like TickTick for Task Management

The Bullet Journal method recommends not using to-do list software, but directly using note-taking software for task management, creating a task note system that can support yourself.

Because these tools lack a support system behind them, the daily action lists they create are often made without careful thought and planning. A bunch of miscellaneous tasks are simply moved from a chaotic mind to a list, remaining in a chaotic state. So when we face to-do lists, we still feel stressed, confused, and anxious.

Another important reason is that tasks are crossed off after completion! You might say, isn't this very satisfying? If a task ends after it's done, it means the task is unimportant or cannot extend more value. These software's note-taking and task management features are often designed for quick recording and task completion, but they don't provide a systematic way to continuously track and improve these tasks, nor do they treat these tasks and projects as personal treasures to be permanently preserved.

The advantage of using note-taking software to build a task management system is that you can continuously improve project notes and task notes. Over time and with practice, project notes and task notes will record our full labor results and wisdom crystallization. Even if projects are archived, they can be easily retrieved when needed in the future. Only this way can these notes become our experience treasury, allowing value to continuously extend, helping us grow continuously, improve constantly, and do better and better.

### Core Principles of Creating Notes with the Bullet Journal Method

1. **One task, one note, task-centered**: The core of notes is tasks, not materials. Each note should revolve around a specific task. Each note should contain clear action steps.
2. **Continuous iteration**: Notes should be continuously improved over time and practice, becoming an accumulation of personal knowledge and experience.
3. **Holistic perspective**: Notes should grasp tasks and projects from an overall perspective, avoiding fragmentation and isolation.
4. **Build project homepages, make good use of links**: Link all materials, related notes, task plans, and actual task progress needed for the project to the project homepage, forming a complete project homepage.

### Important Concepts for Running Time Management and Task Management with the Bullet Journal Method

1. What really needs to be organized in time management and task management
   1. Choose what is important.
   2. Choose how I should act now.
2. Is the core goal of time management and task management to get everything done?
   1. The core goal of time management is not to get everything done, because essentially we cannot get everything done. The things we want to do and need to do are always more than the time we can allocate.
   2. So we must make choices. Choices are not arbitrary, but depend on systems. Through action correlation, task breakdown, and project integration, we can clarify what the best action is.
3. What is the correct process for building a task management system?
   - We should not bury ourselves in a pile of messy things and work hard. This might solve some problems, but will spend a lot of time and energy, and might even go in the wrong direction, ending up with nothing accomplished, feeling like we're busy for nothing.
   - The following order is very important:
     - First step: Set the goals you want to achieve.
     - Second step: Based on goals, set the functions we need, or what phased tasks need to be completed.
     - Third step: Start arranging our actions to gradually realize these functions and goals.
4. How to build a time management and task management system that doesn't miss anything?
   1. Time reminders
   2. But relying only on time reminders can still lead to forgetting due to not seeing them or changes in matters. Another technique is to place actions and tasks where I will definitely pass when I need them, usually somewhere in the project. When I need them, I will definitely pass by, definitely see them, and then take action. You can put related tasks in project notes according to action sequence, so when executing this project, you can know what to do next.
